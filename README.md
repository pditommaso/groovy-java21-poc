# Build groovy with Java 21

Bare simple Gradle project to build Groovy 4 on Java 21 


#### Get started 

```
./gradlew run 
```


Output: 

```
Runtime: Groovy 4.0.21 on OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 21.0.3+9-LTS
```


Use `run.sh` script to run it with a Java version different from the one 
used by to compile and run via Gradle.
